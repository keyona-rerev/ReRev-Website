                        <p><strong>"Greatness is in the agency of others"</strong> - Scott Galloway</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Building Persuasive Materials with AI</h2>
                    <h3>The Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>Your success completely lies in the agency of others. That’s not me being dark, it’s just reality. You have an idea, but what you don’t have is allocated resources and buy-in.</p>
                    <p>At ReRev Labs, we believe sales and marketing are not job roles. They’re skills every working professional needs. The new age of AI has only made that more clear.</p>
                    <p>A big part of selling is succinctly, quickly, and effectively communicating your ideas. The difference between “that sounds interesting” and “let’s move forward” often comes down to someone’s ability to understand what you’re trying to communicate. Not just understand it, but <strong>visualize it</strong> in a way that makes it easy to act on.</p>

                    <div class="insight-box box-blue">
                        <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
                        <p>When you show someone a visual, a clean professional one-pager or interactive pitch, it becomes real. That idea goes from intangible to concrete. It’s something they can show their colleagues. It’s something they can act on.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Skill: Using AI to Generate HTML and CSS</h2>
                    <p>Traditionally, creating polished custom sales materials meant either hiring a designer or spending hours in design tools like Canva. But now, with AI and some basic HTML and CSS knowledge, you can create professional branded one-pagers in minutes.</p>

                    <h3>Step 1: Establish Your Copy</h3>
                    <p>Start with the most important part: the content. Have an iterative conversation with your LLM of choice (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini). Work through questions like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What problem does this solve?</li>
                        <li>Who’s the ideal person to hear this?</li>
                        <li>What action do I want them to take?</li>
                        <li>What do they care about?</li>
                        <li>What's the end benefit?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="insight-box box-blue">
                        <i class="fas fa-microphone-alt"></i>
                        <p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Use <strong>SpeechNotes</strong> (or your preferred voice-to-text tool) to freely converse your thoughts instead of typing. Not only is this faster, it’s more effective.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Step 2: Generate the HTML and CSS</h3>
                    <p>Once your copy is locked in, ask the AI to turn it into a finished product. When it comes to format, I usually choose between an SVG, a one-pager, or a single-scroll website.</p>
                    
                    <div class="insight-box box-blue">
                        <i class="fab fa-apple"></i>
                        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> LLMs are really good at mimicking Apple’s branding. If you want a more refined look, that’s your go-to for it to emulate.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Step 3: Deploy and Customize</h3>
                    <p>I usually paste the code into <strong>CodePen</strong>. Tweak colors, fonts, and spacing to match your brand. You now have a live shareable link.</p>
                    <p>If you want it as a PDF or image, use free HTML-to-PDF converters. To turn your code into an HTML file:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the “Notebook” app on your laptop.</li>
                        <li>Paste the code into a new file.</li>
                        <li>Save as <em>name.html</em>.</li>
                        <li>Upload that file to your chosen converter (HTML2JPG or HTML2PDF).</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                    <p>This lesson came together in sharp focus at a VC training where my business partner and I had to create six presentations in three days. We won all but the first one—and only because we didn’t yet understand the power of this process.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here’s what we did differently: we spent our time as a team on the most important part, the <strong>content</strong>. We recorded our conversations and had an AI pull out the core insights. Then I worked with an AI to produce copy that took those unique, experience-backed insights—the ones that could only come from human interaction. We didn’t rely on the LLM to create its own information; we gave it a strong foundation.</p>

                    <p>Then we followed the exact process laid out above: AI turned it into a single-scroll HTML/CSS website. It felt crisp and clean. Our competitors used AI presentation makers and came out with presentations that looked cute but weren’t functional. We ended up winning the overall competition.</p>

                    <div class="insight-box box-purple">
                        <i class="fas fa-users"></i>

                    </div>

                    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                    <p>By the end of this process, you’ve built at least one custom sales/persuasive artifact using AI and HTML/CSS without having to learn how to code. You’ve employed coding literacy to create something with tangible value for your career tomorrow.</p>

                            <p><strong>If you’re pitching yourself or a prospective client:</strong> Instead of sending an email with your hand out, send something visual and interactive.
